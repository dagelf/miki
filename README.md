Miki - offline first, micro wiki
=================================

How to use
----------

    git clone https://github.com/ryanramage/miki
    cd miki
    open index.html

What about saving data?
------------------------

Miki uses pouchdb to store in the data browser. You can optionally configure each space
to sync with a couchdb. So all your devices can have the same data!

Why Miki
--------

This is a ridiculously small app. ~200 lines of js to show how to make a simple offline
first app in which you own your own data. Please make more of these.

It also shows the power of [ractive](http://ractivejs.org) and [pouchdb](http://pouchdb.com).
